Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hangin' over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
